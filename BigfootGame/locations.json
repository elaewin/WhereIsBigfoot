You're sure that you left it out here last night, but now you don't see it anywhere. \n\nOh well, it was out of oil anyway, and you're pretty sure that the refill bottle is sitting on your kitchen counter where you left it after forgetting to pack it. \n\nTrails lead off through the underbrush to the south, east, and west.",

In fact, he hasn't changed much since college--he's still wearing ripped up jeans and a faded henley under an old red trail jacket. Dan is standing over a small gas camping stove, frying up what looks like about a pound of bacon. A large cooler stands open next to him, and you can see more packages of bacon inside. Next to the stove is a tin can.  A small tent is pitched along the west side of the campsite.  Trails lead north and south into the woods.\nAs you watch, Dan carefully pours hot grease out of the frying pan and into the can. Dan looks up at you and grins. \"Hey, <name>, there you are!\" he says. \"Grab some bacon.\" ",

It stretches out before you, maybe even too big for you to swim across unless you were being chased by an angry Bigfoot or that last date you picked up from Tindr. Let's face it, some things can motivate you to great feats of prowess. But as it stands, this lake is way too big to swim and you're not that motivated. Hills with trees rise up in the distance, but from here you can't see the opposite shore.\n\nTrails lead north along the lakeshore and west into the woods.\n",

You're not sure if it's impressed. Now that you're closer, you see its arms wrapped around a lantern. How did it get the lantern up here? It has eight arms'maybe that should be a clue about how it does anything. You've only got two arms and you can barely get around at all.\n\nThe tree octopus seems kind of possessive of the lantern.
